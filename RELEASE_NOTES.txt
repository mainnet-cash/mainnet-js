* Rework `ElectrumNetworkProvider` to use the latest @electrum-cash/network
  - Breaking: the cluster support is removed
  - Breaking: the provider now behaves the same as the base library, triggering the subscription callbacks immediately after subscribing with some initial request response data returned, such as status, height, etc
  - Breaking: waiting and watching utilities are now async functions and need to be awaited
* Cleanup the old and now obsolete code
  - Remove remnants of smartBCH code
  - Remove `events` and `eventsource`, `stream-browserify` and other webpack dependencies. Cleanup webpack config.
  - Remove `polyfills` directory with now dead code

  - Move lots of common code to the `BaseWallet` from Wif.ts
  - `BaseWallet` is now repurposed from abstract class to be a keyless wallet class (`WatchOnly`), lacking private key related accessors
  - `WatchWallet` now inherits from `BaseWallet`
  - Other private key based wallets (`Seed` and `Wif`) now inherit from `BaseWallet` with many of their properties becoming non-optional
  - Many other properties are now non-optional and do not need the `?.` accessors, like `wallet?.provider`
  - Rework Wallet.util interface to break the circular dependency inducing side effects
* Breaking: remove `qrcode-svg` dependency and remove wallet methods to get QR code images
  - It is now up to user to chose the library for QR code generation and rendering
  - The code snippet to produce the QR codes can be found below:

```typescript
import QRCode from "qrcode-svg";

/**
 * qrAddress returns a qr code for a given cashaddress as raw utf-8 svg
 * @param  {string} address
 * @param  {} size=256 The width and height of the returned image
 * @returns Image
 */
export function qrAddress(address: string, size = 256) {
  const svg = new QRCode({
    content: address,
    width: size,
    height: size,
  }).svg();

  const svgB64 = btoa(svg);
  return {
    src: `data:image/svg+xml;base64,${svgB64}`,
    title: address,
    alt: "a Bitcoin Cash address QR Code",
  };
}
```

2.4.1

* Bugfix: export TransactionHistoryItem interface

2.4.0

* Minor Breaking: Rework Wallet.getHistory method and interfaces with focus on output compatibility with ElectronCash wallet
  * `getHistory` gets transaction history of this wallet with most data decoded and ready to present to user
  * @note balance calculations are valid only if querying to the blockchain tip (`toHeight` === -1, `count` === -1)
  * @note this method is heavy on network calls, if invoked in browser use of cache is advised, @see `Config.UseLocalStorageCache`
  * @note this method tries to recreate the history tab view of Electron Cash wallet, however, it may not be 100% accurate if the tnransaction value changes are the same in the same block (ordering)

* watchBlocks now can take a parameter to not skip current block height notification
* getRawHistory now takes optional fromHeight and toHeight parameters according to updated electrum cash protocol

2.3.16

This fixes the BCMR data not available until a new block confirmation.

1.1.29

* Fix BCMR authchains containing incompatible elements

1.1.28

* Fix source outputs lockingBytecode derivation

1.1.2

* Rework and simplify token utxo selection
* Require to always provide commitment and capability for tokens sent
* Allow to build unsigned transactions (for watch only wallets too)
Example:

```
const { unsignedTransaction, sourceOutputs } = await watchWallet.send({...}), { buildUnsigned: true });
```

Where `unsignedTransaction` is a hex-encoded serialized transaction. It will have its inputs unlocking bytecode to be empty.

`sourceOutputs` will contain the detailed information about the inputs being spent, including lockingBytecode, satoshi values and token information.
This information can be used to recreate the signing context for libauth.

1.1.1

* Add stricter token utxo selection, add 3 more cashtoken regression tests
* Fix counting FT and NFT token balances, fixes #175
* Add safeguarding check against malformed tokenIds supplied to token mint and burn functions

1.1.0

Upgrade @mainnet-cash/contract package with new libauth and cashscript, additionally bringing full support for cashtokens in contracts.

Commit message:
```
Breaking: replace UtxoItem with UtxoI everywhere
Upgrade contract package to use cashscript 0.8.0
Upgrade libauth to 2.0.0-alpha.8
Add libauth template generation from cashscript contracts
```

Upgrade notes:
All methods returning utxos in form `{"utxos": UtxoItem[]}`:
```
{
  "utxos": [
    "txId": "abcd",
    "index": 0,
    "value": 1000
  ]
}
```

will now be returning `UtxoI[]`:
```
[
  "txid": "abcd",
  "vout": 0,
  "satoshis": 1000
]
```
This change is intended to unify interfaces and return type, and to eliminate unnecessary interfaces.

To convert UtxoI <-> UtxoId use new `toUtxoId` and `fromUtxoId` methods.

      ...
      <script defer src="mainnet.js"></script>
    </head>

    <body>
