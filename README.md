# mainnet.js

A high-level developer friendly interface to interact with Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network (prototype stage)

# Unstable

This code is in a prototype stage, so there is no backwards-compatibility guarantee

# Installation

    git clone https://github.com/mainnet-cash/mainnet-js.git
    yarn

# Running library tests

    npx test

or (a bit slower):

    yarn test

The testing harness should automatically start a docker image with
a Bitcoin Cash Node and Fulcrum in regtest mode. The test covers
the library, as well as the rest API server.

# Running browser tests

    npx test:browser

or

    yarn test:browser

Tests in the browser require for the library to be bundled for the browser. With:

    yarn build

The bundle is built with webpack and does **not** use browserify, rather it simply
omits nodejs libraries. Browser tests are run against testnet, using secrets stored
in a `.env.testnet` file or the environment variables `ALICE_TESTNET_ADDRESS`
and `ALICE_TESTNET_WALLET_ID`. These variables should be protected to the extent that
getting more testnet coins is an annoyance.

# Workflow

## Overview

To implement even the simplest function, is a multi step process. It's fastest to follow these steps in order:

1. Write the finished REST specification
2. Implement the function in Typescript as closely to the pattern of the spec as possible
3. **Fully test** the typescript functions
4. Rebuild the REST server from spec
5. Add required endpoint services, adding new files to .openapi-generator-ignore as necessary.
6. **Fully test** the rest endpoints
7. Finally, it must work in the browser so, **fully test** an integrated workflow with a `*.test.headless.js` file.

## Specification

This is a specification driven project. The rest interface is defined using OpenAPI 3
in a folder called [swagger](swagger/v1/api.yml).

Changes may be validated using openapi-generator locally using:

    yarn api:validate

If you need better validation, you may also try [a swagger web editor](https://editor.swagger.io/)

## Typescript library

All code for the javascript library should be contained in src/.

The javascript library is meant to mimic the REST API defined by the specification to the extent possible.

So the endpoint defined at `wallet/send` should match the behavior of `mywallet.send(...)` .

Prior to implementing a REST service, it is fastest to **thoroughly test** and debug issues in typescript.

## Testing

Tests for the library are run with:

    yarn test

## Developing the API server

Much of the code for the REST server is automatically generated from the specification. **NOTE** the express server automatically enforces required fields and return types for the service.

The express server is committed in a folder called `generated/serve` but needs to be updated on any changes to the swagger specifications to match correctly:

    yarn api:build:server

To install the requirements from project root:

    yarn api:serve:install

**Important:** The server automatically uses a [link](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/link)ed copy of `mainnet-js` referencing the project root directory. It is important to note that this is essentially a symlink version and removing `node_modules/mainnet-js/*` on the server may attempt to delete the project root directory contents. It is safe to remove `generated/serve/node_modules/`, but never attempt to remove the contents of `generated/serve/node_modules/mainnet-js/` without [unlink](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/unlink)ing first:

```
# in ./generated/serve/
yarn unlink mainnet-js
```

To start the API server for development:

    yarn api:serve

To run multiple instances of the API server in "cluster" mode:

    yarn api:serve:cluster

## REST Testing

Tests for the express server may be run with:

    yarn test:api

The `mainnet-js` package is linked to the REST expressServer automatically after installing the respective package requirements. Updating `mainnet-js` with code changes is handled automatically by the `test:api` command.

If the mainnet-js library function being tested is not implemented correctly, no amount of debugging the service endpoint will cause it to work.

If there are any failing tests in REST assure that similar coverage exists in `mainnet-js` src prior to debugging.

## Browser Testing

Browsers do not have access to many standard node libraries by design. For this reason, some libraries either don't work in the browser or don't work in nodejs.

All browser tests are denoted by `*.test.headless.js`.

Integration tests for the browser can be run so:

    yarn test:browser

Unit testing is not as critical for the browser, but may be helpful in places, to narrow the scope of potential issues.

## Developing API clients

To generate clients in a particular language, use:

    yarn api:build:client <generator_name>

For a list of generators see:

https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators/

If you need additionalProperties passed to the client generator, these may be added in
he [wrapper script](swagger/generate.js)

# Configuration Variables

## Express

    PORT=3000  # The port express will run on
    URL_PATH   # The url express is serving from

    WORKERS=10 # How many threads to run express on
    TIMEOUT=60 # sets the default timeout for requests

### Database

Postgres configuration is passed url encoded

    DATABASE_URL='postgres://postgres:trusted@localhost:15432/wallet'

By default, the API service assumes it is connected to a secured private postgres database. If you intend to expose the api to the general public this setting **MUST** be changed to **'false'**, default is true.

    ALLOW_MAINNET_USER_WALLETS=true

## Wallet Behavior

**In nodejs only**, Controls the number responses from electrum-cash nodes that must be in agreement for a network response to return

    CLUSTER_CONFIDENCE=1

## Mining

If you would like to mine some regtest coins, the following environment variables are used:

    RPC_USER="alice"
    RPC_PASS="password"
    RPC_PORT=18443
    RPC_HOST=bitcoind

The above variables should be configured already in `.env.regtest` for integration tests against docker services

## Regtest Wallet

Below are the public and private keys for a regtest wallet

    ADDRESS="bchreg:qpttdv3qg2usm4nm7talhxhl05mlhms3ys43u76rn0"
    ADDRESS_LEGACY="18uVyRcvE7RdR9WFLyD1kMPjehKxyE91in"
    PRIVATE_WIF="cNfsPtqN2bMRS7vH5qd8tR8GMvgXyL5BjnGAKgZ8DYEiCrCCQcP6"
    PRIVATE_SEED="pink wash guitar agree screen suspect soon misery dog menu issue recipe"

## Testnet Wallet

For now, testnet integration tests use static wallets:

    ALICE_TESTNET_ADDRESS   # A testnet address    ALICE_TESTNET_WALLET_ID # A wallet in mainnet serialized format
    BOB_TESTNET_ADDRESS     # A wallet for the Bob
    BOB_TESTNET_WALLET_ID   # His serialized walletId

These will be removed at a later date when an API is configured.

# Deployment and package publishing

The workflow is simple, bump the version, commit, push to github and create a release with a tag name equal to the version to which the project got bumped.

The github actions will then take care about everything else.

See details below.

## Versioning

The version format follows the `semver` - semantic versioning.

Use the `bump_version` utility to increment the project version. It will as well be propagated to swagger API version.

See https://github.com/npm/node-semver

### Incrementing version

Execute `node bump_version.js` to simply increase the project's patch version.

### Incrementing other versions

Use `node bump_version.js major`, `node bump_version.js minor`, `node bump_version.js patch` to increase x, y and z in the x.y.z version format, respectively.

Use `node bump_version.js prerelease rc`, `node bump_version.js prerelease alpha`, `node bump_version.js prerelease beta` to increase the prerelease version with rc, alpha or beta designations.

`node bump_version.js prerelease rc` will produce version `x.y.z-rc.0`. With `0` incrementing further to `1`, etc.

### Enforcing certain version

Execute `node bump_version.js x.y.z` to set the project and swagger version to `x.y.z`

## Publishing

Upon creation of a new release on the github, the github publishing actions will be triggered.

Among these are:

- docker image with API REST server for self hosting `mainnet/mainnet-rest`, requires `DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD` secret
- rest server https://rest-unstable.mainnet.cash, requires `COMMIT_USER_TOKEN` secret, which is the github access token
- npm package `mainnet-js`, requires `NPM_TOKEN` secret
- python pypi package `mainnet` with autogenerated client, requires `PYPI_TOKEN` secret
- php composer package `mainnet/mainnet` with autogenerated client, requires `PACKAGIST_TOKEN` secret

Trying to republish/rerelease the same version will fail miserably
